# SeniorProject
The collect of the 3 demonstrations I made that use procedural generation for my Senior Project.

These demonstrations only work on systems with Java installed and can only be fully taken advantage of on a Mac using a PlayStation 4 controller. Download Demos.jar to test the demonstrations.

The controls for the first screen of the Demo.jar are W and S or the Up and Down arrow keys press Enter to select a demonstration once in a demonstration press M to see a controls screen, and p.s. WASD or the arrow keys can be used to move around in the first demonstration.

These demonstrations rely on the libGDX game development framework.
The code for these demonstrations is poorly commented.
