# SeniorProject
The collect of the 3 demonstrations I made that use procedural generation for my Senior Project.

These demonstrations can only be fully taken advantage of on a Mac using a PlayStation 4 controller.

These demonstrations rely on the libGDX game development framework.
The code for these demonstrations is poorly commented.
